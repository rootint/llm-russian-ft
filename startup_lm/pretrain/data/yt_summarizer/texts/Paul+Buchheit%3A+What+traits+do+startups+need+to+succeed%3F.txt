I think focus is one of the most important things because as a startup, it's actually I think your most powerful weapon. The reason that you're able to take on these big companies or whatever is because they're doing a thousand different things. The only way you can win is if you take everything you have and you focus it at one point because you are underpowered in every way versus these other companies. The one thing you do have that they don't have is you can be absolutely 100% focused on the thing that you're doing. With Google, that was part of the reason that we won at Search. All we were focused on early on. You became the best in the world at it. Versus everyone else is like, oh, we want to be a portal. We need all this other shit. That's really key. Frugality, I think, is also really essential. I think one of the best indicators of if you're doing it right is essentially your input to output ratio. You want to do more with less. Unfortunately, most startups do less with more. You give them money and they just burn it up and there's no result. Being able to produce a lot of outputs with a minimum amount of time and money.
