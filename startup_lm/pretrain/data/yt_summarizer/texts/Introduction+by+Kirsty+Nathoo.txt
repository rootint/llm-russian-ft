Hello everyone, my name is Kirstie Nathoo, I am one of the partners at Y Combinator and I would like to wish you a very warm welcome to this amazing venue for Start-Up School. This is our first international Start-Up School that we have done, so we are very excited to be here in London with you all. We have travelled a long way and we would like to thank you as well. We know from reading the applications that a lot of you have travelled not just within the UK, but also from Europe and from the rest of the world, so thank you for coming here today. We have an amazing day of events of speakers for you today, but before we start with those, just a couple of housekeeping points. We have the hashtag Start-Up School, so please do tweet throughout the day and use that hashtag so you can see what is going on. You can follow us on Twitter at Start-Up School and at Y Combinator. Also, be sure to download the Weave app so that you can see who else is here today and find people that you would like to meet with and arrange times to meet up with them. There is plenty of time to talk to people both in breaks and at lunchtime and we will be serving food and drinks at that point. We are also going to be doing a question and answer session today with some of the Y Combinator partners and it is your chance to ask us any questions that you have. The way that we are going to do this is you are going to email us any questions to Start-Up School at Y Combinator and you will see that coming up on the screen during breaks to remind you. Please get your questions in by 4pm and then we can go through and we will do our best to answer as many as we possibly can in the short time that we have available to us.
