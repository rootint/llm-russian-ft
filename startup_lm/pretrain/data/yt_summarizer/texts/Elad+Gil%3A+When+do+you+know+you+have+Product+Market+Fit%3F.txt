Yeah, I think it's obvious if you think about it the right way, but I think it's very hard otherwise. So, I'll give you three examples of signs that you have product market fit from three different companies. If your product is broken and people are still using it very actively, or you have high retention on a broken product, that's a clear sign of product market fit. When Twitter was constantly going down in the fail whale days, and yet nobody moved off of Twitter, that was a sign of just raw market adoption. A second sign is if you're a SaaS company and you have major brands finding and using you organically and paying for your product, that's a sign of product market fit. So, examples of that would be PagerDuty, which had, I think, Apple as an early customer. There's Zeppelin, which had, I think, Facebook using them very early. Airtable has all sorts of brands that have just sort of adopted it. So, I think there's a number of sort of more recent breakout-y companies where big brands are just showing up and starting to pay, and I think that's a clear sign of product market fit. The last one is just whether you have very strong customer feedback, even from a small group of people. So, at Color, for example, very early on, we were getting, effectively, love letters from our customers. The company Color started off focused on providing people with information about their hereditary risk of certain genetically-driven cancers, and we were getting emails from people where they were saying, thank you so much for helping me, for making this affordable, for saving their lives. In some cases, they felt that Color would help with that. And so, we got very strong customer feedback very early on.
