Hello Berlin We made it to week 10, this is the last Stop on the startup school tour We have something kind of special today. So a door and I are doing a presentation together and it's all based on Numbers from the last nine weeks of startup school. She's gonna sort of kick it off and What we're gonna do is probably talk for like hopefully 20 minutes and then we'll open up to Q&A to answer all of your questions or anything else you want to talk about and then we'll have like more mingling and Eating and such until we have to kick you out and go have you work on your company or apply to YC That's what you still have left to do at 8 p.m Adora 5 5 a.m. Berlin time 5 a.m. Berlin time. So plenty of time All right, thank you Kevin Thanks for being here So Kevin said my name is Adora. I'm one of the partners at YC and we're just going to go over what we learned during startup school So it's week 10. We made it congratulations The startup school team has been in the past few weeks traveling around the world Visiting cities where there's lots of startup school founders. We've been we've done 20 events at this point Over 15 cities and we've interacted with over 2,000 founders in person So similar to how we started we wanted to end startup school by looking at the numbers. Most of you don't know this but Start school actually grew a lot during the course itself when we held orientation back in July end of July we were around 20,000 founders and 21,000 startups with over 20,000 people auditing the course Just for the content and as we let more people in during the course as of today the numbers swelled by over 40% So you'll see we have now over 40,000 founders in startup school and over 30,000 startups there are over 77,000 people actually subscribe to the content and over Yeah with with the number of people Increasing between 30 and 50 percent really cool that female founders increased the most here So one of the things that we want to look at Was whether startup school made a difference So we looked at the last two batches to see how last year's participants Compared to the rest of the population in regards to their ability to get funding from YC so in the end from the past two batches 9.7% of start school applicants that applied got an interview versus 9.1% of Non startup school applicants got interviewed that means 6.6% If you did start school 6.6% you had a higher chance of getting interviewed and we think this year It'll be much much higher because we focus the course a lot on Helping you build that application and just focus your startup on The right things to Get get those questions done. Well All right So if you look deeper into the numbers as of today a hundred and six startup school companies have been accepted into YC For a group of people who are more likely to get interviewed. You'd think they look amazing on paper. They got into YC But you would be wrong startup school founders accepted into YC are surprisingly different In every week in every city we visited founders are constantly asking us To see if YC still wants to accept companies that are not perfect that are like them But not perfect and the big takeaway is is that YC is not afraid of warts and we can assure you no startup We've ever Accepted has been perfect so Dig a little bit deeper into these hundred six companies from startup school that has gotten to a YC already Forty of them had no traction when they got in so that means no revenue no users yet 57 also had no revenue 50 had no funding whatsoever Meaning zero zero dollars cash in the bank Some of them didn't even incorporate yet Quite a few of them were still working at jobs or might have in college and still working part-time 40 of them applied previously So this is one of the things as we encourage you even if you don't get in is to keep trying again a lot Of people apply three to four times and on that fourth or fifth try they get in Some of the companies we didn't really like the idea they applied with and they actually pivoted during the batch And so that counts for a dozen of them and a lot of them applied late. So by the time you watch this video You're applying late and we still encourage you to apply And finally, this is the most asked question in our tour Which is if I'm a solo founder should I still can I still do YC and the question is absolutely? Yes, ten single founders got in from start school We average around 10% of the batches around solo founders now, it's not a little bit more than that We highly encourage every team to have a technical co-founder, but if you don't it does not disqualify you In fact three of the startup school companies that have gotten into YC were not technical All right, so how can you replicate their success It's very simple and we're about to I'm about to repeat a lot of things. We've already said during a startup school But the best thing you can do is when you talk about your startup, there's a question on the applications is what are you making and That is to be very clear or it is and if you've watched Kevin's lecture from a couple weeks ago The next few slides will seem very familiar. So one is be clear on what you're working on no jargon Not only be clear, but don't use all the words in dictionary be very concise and how you get your point across So to be even more specific on that question on the application of what are you working on? Startups that I got that have gotten accepted to YC use on average 78 words To describe what they do So 78 words might seem a little or a lot to you. But in fact what it does is it looks like this It's two paragraphs and gets your point across well so if you have something that looks longer than this and you should really go through your description and start cutting words and Finding sentences that you really don't need to have them there All right, so if this is what a description should look like what should a description not look like well Here's an example of this is literally this is actually one of my favorite ones Because as you'll see next of a description that did not get accepted or get an interview So we couldn't fit the whole thing in here But if you read like this guy or I forgot who the founder is But he basically knows he needs to write something short but decides to But decides to write a wall of text. In fact, that wall of text was the longest description we got of all applications In the past two batches. It was over 2,000 words Obviously, please don't do this. It doesn't help us understand your startup any better. It actually just confuses more and frustrates us It basically tells us that you don't know how It basically tells us that you don't know how to be efficient when it comes to getting people to understand what your startup does So if you think about it if this is how long it takes you to describe what you do if you can imagine when You come in for a 10-minute interview You'll the interview would be done before you even you know finish your description Furthermore at what culminates at the end of YC itself is a two-minute demo day pitch. So again That's even less time to get your point across and so you really need to start practicing now on how you deliver Your how you deliver on how you explain your company The good news is in startup school when you apply or when you've registered you had to fill out your company description And we actually forced you To write it in less than 200 characters or less Now this is a histogram of a number of characters of words that startup school companies use and you can see that a lot of you Got to the 200th character and probably want it to write more But have to stop because we forced you. Stop it The result is this description actually averages around 40 words or less so By force we've made you do it less than the average of 78 words. So that's good news So when you transfer your descriptions to your YC application We suggest you to not expand much further than what you've the number of words you've already used All right So one thing we noticed and we're worried about was the lack of editing on your hand when you entered in that startup school description So over the course over the 10-week course, we've been trying to help you Make that description a little bit better. In fact, a lot of the group sessions were designed to help you with that but as you've been practicing pitching every week many of you didn't actually go back into your profile and Edit your company profiles with a better description It's actually the one thing we do at YC to help Startups more than anything else is really get down there one or two liner and there's descriptions. So the next startup school We're going to probably focus more on helping you do that and forcing you to document your changes over time The median number of edits was only one. So We think that most likely the description you have right now can be improved on drastically So if you need more tips on how to do this well Kevin's last lecture How to evaluate ideas part 2 that's a name on the YouTube channel Please please go watch as you see a lot of the slides are lifted from there. So, all right I'm gonna let Kevin take over for the next bit You guys submitted a lot of data to us every week. We ask companies to Let us know about their progress if you got an email from the Kevin inspirational back Then you know that basically we're trying to get you to just spend 10 to 15 minutes at the most so just tell us like what's been going on with your company and In the last nine weeks, that's been over a hundred and twenty four thousand pieces of data And so we've got a lot of interesting insights from them The first thing is concerning What Start school companies considered their biggest obstacle So not surprising to us, but all but it is kind of worrisome Number one was funding you you were worried about lack of resources and you couldn't move forward as a result of not having money and The other one that's interesting on here is like meeting a co-founder at number six And the reason I'm kind of point these out is that if you look at what people said actually improved their KPI The metric that they considered mattered the most when we did the text analysis. It looks very different So you think your biggest problem is one thing, but the thing that would actually help you the most are very different So number one, of course is launching getting out the door. Once you launch you can move that KPI, which is wonderful All that stuff on here a lot of it concerning product and things dealing with the users If you're having problems where the difference between What you think your biggest obstacle is and the thing that makes the biggest difference to your KPI are two different lists like this Watch a doors lecture. She talks about how to prioritize your time. It's actually doing really really well on YouTube it's the fastest spreading one a lot of people found her tips in there on how to think about Your to-do list in a much more KPI driven way. Very very helpful we asked You to talk to your users and tell us what did you learn from them? And these are the top things that people got not surprisingly. They're focused on product and basically The best thing you can do is make something people want and the top two insights because they're focused on conversion and monetization I've got two lectures that we did back-to-back on improving landing page conversion and Pricing so those are good places to start if you want to improve things for your users Now actually most of the participants unfortunately in startup school Did not launch and so when you were considered not launched the KPI that you tracked was weeks to launch and so these are the numbers and how they came out people on average went from WTL weeks to launch of seven weeks down to Five weeks at the end for some reason that should Have been to zero right now What's actually super interesting here is that the median weeks to launch is about four So that indicates that in the average there It's being actually very much impacted by people having very large weeks to launch. That's really bad and so if you haven't already You're gonna find a theme here for this presentation watch Michael's lecture on how to plan an MVP He talks about how you should only be making the first version that takes just a few weeks to launch And so even that meeting is double the number that we recommend for our companies In that talk he also coined a new term that we've been using it's herps going at YC the heavy MPP and this is if you're a hard tech or biotech company You might need to build something that's a little more substantial and in fact you guys actually believe you do need to you're almost double the number of weeks to launch that you estimate and Unfortunately, if you look at the graphs by comparison, so this is the average startup school weeks to launch Is it's going slightly down over time? This is the biotech hard tech people you guys actually go up over time. You somehow add features over the course of the week and That's not good because actually from our experience funding over 200 biotech hard tech companies is that They should be following different advice or rules than other companies I'm just why we recommend if you haven't watched it watching Jared's lecture on advice for biotech and hard tech companies He basically talks about seven wonderful examples of YC companies that built a much lighter weight heavy MPP and Creative ways of getting their company off the ground even though they don't have millions of dollars and lots of time to build the first version For the companies that did launch you guys did great so this number represents the percentage of the weekly updates that were submitted that came from companies that launched so at the beginning of the course a third of the weekly updates came from launch companies and by the end Half of them were from launch companies. That's super awesome. In fact 1,253 startups we can actually track switch from weeks to launch to a different KPI During startup school to put this into perspective for us It took over 10 years for Y Combinator to launch that many companies through our program and in search Well, we did in 10 weeks doors gonna talk about group sessions Alright, as you know every week during startup school We matched you with other startups to help you practice talking about your own startups And we rated everybody at the end would rate each other on three metrics. Did you understand this idea? Were you excited about the idea and would you want to work with the founders? for the first question Over time you guys got better at explaining your idea as you can see the differential from each week to week was Over 0.1 percent to put that in perspective a 0.1 percent Increase represents almost a hundred startups because of the number of startups in startup school and by the end there was a 7.1 percent increase at the overall, all right in terms of Improving on selling yourselves. You guys also got better over time. There was a 9.5 percent improvement from the beginning the biggest improvement Was actually getting other people excited about it your idea. And so there was a 17 percent improvement since the beginning We know that there's a lot more work that needs to be done here We want to in the future create a lecture to help you get better at getting other people emotionally excited about your ideas being able to do that helps you with things like recruiting and Getting customers on board and also investors on board in the future If you want more help instructing your investor pitch Kevin Kevin's lecture for Second lecture it was called how to evaluate startup ideas part one. I would go watch that All right. So while the quantitative ratings made it easier to get founders involved Startup school founders loved it when you actually gave each other qualitative feedback comments after the group session. We were Amazed to see how supportive everyone was with each other in terms of giving this feedback. In fact over 93,000 pieces of qualitative feedback were created during the course So many of you have offered to help with introductions to customers often whispered words of encouragement That we know made a huge difference to someone struggling to make the magic happens One of the main reasons for doing these group sessions together It's sort of like emotional supporting group therapy because we're all going through the same things And so I think that achieved the result we were looking for in that sense The generosity we saw in the comments is what makes doing Doing a startup in a batch incredibly powerful. So thank you for everyone for taking the time to do this It really means a lot to everyone on the flip side not all of you are great a bunch of you know showed So 19% of startups who requested participate in a group session did not show up Yes So this graph shows updates requests for group sessions and attendance and no-shows over the last nine weeks Oddly enough 23% of startups who submitted a weekly update didn't even request a group session We're looking for the next time for the next course of how to make this easier And more convenient for startups because we think that this has been actually helpful Not just in improving your pitch, but also for morale reasons Entry interesting enough this graph actually shows where we messed up in the first week So that big gap there between number of updates submitted and request Requested shows that you guys were very confused about how to request group sessions at the very start of start with school And that's why we gave everyone a free me on that first one and that sort of stabilizes as we get down Just like how you guys are probably using metrics to help improve your startup we are to as well Okay, so we also asked you guys to submit how are you feeling what's your morale I'm working on your startup and overall Out of a hundred and twenty four thousand pieces of weekly feedback and you can see the trend is you got a little happier over time But we actually wanted to segment this out to see what actually really impacted and what made a big difference from around for companies and so it led to some of the most Interesting and unique insights from the program for us at Y Combinator First one technical startups. No surprise are happier You're just able to get more done One thing to notice is you'll think that the difference here and changes are small But because of the amount of data that we're collecting across each one of them. These are pretty statistically significant and so if you're looking to be Quantitatively happier. These are ways to do it If you launch you're a little bit happier than the unlaunched people One thing that helped a lot of companies to rethink how they thought about launching was watching cats lecture on how to launch Again, and again It just really changed that bar from being a launch that requires press to being one that is just about shipping and deploying on a regular basis If you're full-time on your startup, you're a lot happier obviously Probably because you can also make more progress If you're making money You're happier The whole aphorism money can't buy you happiness not true Adore has got a good lecture on this on focusing on revenue how to set KPIs It's her first lecture from the startup school, and I actually think it's one of the underappreciated ones It's a lecture that really talks about why 99% of you should be focused on revenue and be honest with yourself about Whether you're actually doing that or not Here's one. That's really surprising People who did not flake on group sessions were way happier than people who did Basically feeling like you're doing a startup and having other people to talk to and being part of the community and batch Meant that you're happier working in your startup than those who did not participate at all The happiest cohort was actually people who were in teams and this is actually one of the main reasons We always say that we want companies to try to have co-founders It is so hard to do a startup on your own and this is usually Morale is the thing that kills a lot of companies and founders And so again when we talk about we want you to try to have a co-founder it is to help with the longevity of your startup not because we just don't want to select those that don't have teams and Then this was the most surprising thing that we learned from startup school That founders and teams that talk to users were way happier over time than those who didn't and What's interesting about these two cohorts? Is that the people who did not talk to any users at all? They were the only cohort that actually had morale get worse over the course of startup school in the nine weeks than those who didn't so the lesson The moral of this morale Are you feeling sad? Talk to users It doesn't take very much to do it the median number of users that start school Teams talk to with just three users a week It actually provides a ton of insight for you, but apparently better than Prozac If you want more information about how to talk to users and a better way of handling that In a sort of structured way that helps you improve your product watch Eric's lecture from the first week of startup school Let's bring it home a door in summary from this presentation Start school helps you get interviewed. It's okay not to be perfect. Like you can get accepted even if you have a word Try to write your description in 78 words or less Prioritize launching You're probably taking too long to launch practice makes you better at pitching talking about getting people to understand you get excited and want to work with you and Lastly talking to users make you happy Which is why we're going to switch over to talking to you guys Thank you so much You
