When I started Gobble, I looked for a co-founder and I spent, I kind of just started it, like I found chefs on Craigslist and I was delivering food in my car, but I was dating co-founders that are now other YC founders at the time. And no one at that time in that like three, four month period was willing to quit their job and join me or was randomly as passionate about my idea as I was. So it was a unique, this was all very organic. I didn't really think, you know, I must have a co-founder or I must be a solo co-founder. I tried to find one and my priority was like leaping on this idea. And so I didn't find one and I just went with it. Long term, I think it is hard, very hard as a single founder. Right now, our exec team operates kind of like as a hive mind and I share everything with them. So after many, many years, now we have like a five person super team that's all very invested and kind of like a co-founding team, but at scale. In the early days, what I say for single founders is you kind of have, like if you're swimming in the ocean, it's kind of like a net buoy system. So you have to find like three or six people that are like those orange buoys and you're swimming by yourself and you're super, super tired. And when you want to rest, you like swim over to one of the buoys and you hug it and you like talk to them and they help you. But then since you don't have a co-founder, no one can be your rock, right? So next time you're like, you know, need to rest, you swim over to another buoy and you hug that, you know, and you kind of like, you basically crowdsource your co-founder from other founders and friends and you have to really find. And in fact, some of my closest friends were other single founders. And so I had a group of like two or three single founders and we all like would constantly meet up for coffee or drinks after work and trade stories and help each other.
