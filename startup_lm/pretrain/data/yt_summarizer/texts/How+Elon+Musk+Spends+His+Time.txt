How do you spend your days now? Like what do you allocate most of your time to? My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla and of course I try to spend part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks and then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week. But other than that it's really SpaceX and Tesla. And what do you do when you're at SpaceX or Tesla? What does your time look like there? Yeah, so that's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on business-y things, but actually almost all my time, like 80% of it is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design. So it's developing next generation product. That's 80% of it. You probably don't remember this, but a very long time ago, many, many years ago, you took me on a tour of SpaceX. And the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it. And I don't think many people get that about you. Yeah, I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something. Which is fine, like business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwen Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She kind of manages legal, finance, sales, and kind of general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team working on improving the Falcon 9 and the Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial Architecture. And then at Tesla, it's working on the Model 3 and some in the design studio, which I'm very happy to be a week, dealing with aesthetics and look and feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology
