I'm looking for a new video game to play, can you give me a recommendation? Overwatch. I play Overwatch. Yeah, it's great. Anything else? Um... Overwatch is amazing. Overwatch is amazing, yeah. Generally Blizzard does great stuff. Um... Well, there's Hearthstone. I haven't tried that one yet. Yeah. I know people love it. That's what my kids play the most, is Hearthstone. Alright. Also from Blizzard. I will check that out tonight. Alright, well thank you very much for the time and I gotta get going. Cool. Do you play anything besides Overwatch? Um... Have you tried the new Deus Ex? I have tried the new Deus Ex. It's okay, but like... The best game I played recently, and it's not a super new game, is The Last of Us. Oh, is it really? It's from a couple of years ago. Sure. I loved it. Okay, Last of Us. Yeah. You like that too? It's really good. Is it really good? It's great. Uncharted 2. Yeah, I've heard good things about Uncharted. I've never seen storytelling like that in a video game. I mean, honestly, I think that's really neglected. I mean, that's the criticism I've heard of the latest Deus Ex, is the storytelling is kind of lame. Whereas the prior Deus Ex, and the original Deus Ex, the storytelling was amazing. I don't know if anybody's played. Did you play the original Deus Ex? That was killer. Yeah. As games have become more like the replacement for the NFL, I think the storytelling just gets generally neglected. So it was especially striking to play one that was absolutely cinematic storytelling. Yeah, and some of the oldest games, the graphics and sound were terrible, so they had to rely on storytelling. But the story was so good. Yeah. Like the old Mario games had incredible story. Yeah.
