If you don't have a U.S. visa, can you still do YC? The short answer to this question is yes, you can. We have lots of founders that are not U.S. citizens and don't have a U.S. visa when they apply to YC, do YC. It's almost never a problem. The most common option for founders in this situation is called a B-1 visa. If you want to Google that, it's like B-1 space visa, which is a temporary business visa. They're quite easy to get, and we have a lot of experience helping founders to get them. It's very rarely an issue to get a B-1 visa for the three to four months that you'll spend in YC. So if you're not American and you're still interested in doing YC, don't worry, the visa is not gonna be the problem.
