Okay, in the beginning, one of the highs is just that you're constantly innovating. That 24-7 maker time is very precious to me. By contrast, now my day is full of meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, and then dinners. And so yesterday I get home at 11 p.m., today we're starting at 8 a.m., and it's really full, and I have to fight for strategic time and maker time. And we still need that to keep evolving, right? So I cherish that part of the early days. Obviously the lows are when nobody cares about you. You barely have any customers. I'm just sleeping at our office or laying on our couch, and I remembered in some of the lows I just would put white paper all over, and I'd lay on the floor, and it'd just be like a blank slate, and I'd be like, okay, what's next? Come up with it. And so those are the lows. The highs now are it's really gratifying when people start to know you, and every time I meet a customer in the wild, it makes my day. And when I get too far from the customer, I actually notice myself getting unhappy again. I think if you care about the customer and that experience long-term, all the money will come.
