Welcome everyone to Y combinator startup investor school if you think you're at a different class you should leave now So it's great to see you all here, I'm Jeff Ralston, and I'm going to act kind of as the master of ceremonies I'll be introducing the various sessions and the The great instructors that we have both from within YC and externally This is our first time teaching startup investor school. I think I have a welcome slide so well, so Please excuse any kinks. I guess we've already had some coffee kinks this morning and As I mentioned Caltrain was a little bit late, so we're a little bit late getting started I will ask that in general we get started promptly. Let me let me just start by Talking about the course structure. This is a Sort of a MOOC a massively open online course we're live streaming as well as with an in-person group here in Mountain View The the live stream will take place in case any of you aren't here in future days at investor dot startup school org The course description the curriculum the syllabus will all be there along with Resources that we deem relevant to the course each day The doors are going to open here at 930 every morning some of you came earlier than that the doors were open They may be they may not be but we're going to try to be fairly prompt there And we'll have some snacks out as you'll see for people here, and we'll have some lukewarm coffee for you The classes will begin as promptly as possible at 10 a.m.. I know you're all very busy so we're going to try to be on time as much as possible there's going to be a Looks like there's going to be a brief 10 minute break I'm sure that's not going to work because anytime I've ever seen a 10 minute break it ends up being a little bit longer But we'll try to keep it to around 10 minutes at 1050 And then we'll have the second part of the course at 11 most of the courses will actually run till 1230 today We're going to end closer to 12 even though we start a little late, so it'll be a little bit afterwards So each day except today apparently we'll begin promptly at 10 a.m.. The the way the course is organized There's a lecture, and then there's a Q&A afterwards, so please hold your questions Until the Q&A session at the end unless the an instructor explicitly says they want questions during their talk I Will also take questions from the streaming audience To to ask a question, please use the Twitter hashtag Pound YCS is and we'll take as many of those questions as we can time-willing So there's a mixture here of Watching the class of accredited and non accredited investors For the accredited investors as most of you know we are going to be an extent going to be extending a invite to YCS winter 2018 demo days which are March 19th and 20th It's a virtual invite and you can watch it online, but also as a cool little kicker. We're going to invite randomly ten of you to come in person to YC demo day which is which is kind of a pretty special occasion and and I hope you're I hope Whoever comes enjoys it a lot So This is our first time teaching this class Hopefully not the last We do ask you guys to give us feedback for what worked what didn't work What was too obvious or too subtle what was missing at the end of the class will be a survey? I'll say this again at the end, but please do give us feedback You can also give us feedback real-time as you like you can email me at Jeff GEO FF at Y combinator comm anytime you like Honest opinions are great. I want to start off also by pointing out. I won't be up here very much It's mostly a bunch of instructors from inside and outside I see they're all volunteers, and they're very busy people and they've been gracious enough to Donate their incredible experience in time to us, and I'm very grateful for everyone who said who agreed to do this Before we get started I wanted to spend a couple of minutes saying why talking about why we're doing this How many of you have made angel investments before could you raise your hands So you don't need any of this crap you guys have already done this okay so there's a lot of experience, and we know there's a lot of experience, but We're doing this for mainly two reasons One is that angel and seed investors are a critical part of the startup ecosystem. It's the first money in usually It's what allows companies to actually take flight and and become real big interesting scalable companies It's also a little self-serving we think that more Great angel investors great seed investors are great for YC companies And we hope you will invest in YC companies the we also think it's good for you for people People who have all of you who have invested you know it's an amazing way to get a window into the to the future to be part of this future that That founders are really creating to get a window into what's going to happen so So it's all good What are we hoping? the outcomes will be Venture investing has been around for Depending on how you look hundreds of years But really the kind of venture investing that that we think of in Silicon Valley for the last 50 years this guy named George Dorio made Made a he was a VC. It was an early VC This firm called AR DC, and he made what we'd consider a seed investment of $70,000 in 1957 until this new Tiny computer company called digital equipment corporation sometimes called digital often called deck and that's $70,000 turned into 35 million dollars Which a lot of people found pretty interesting that led to kick-started an incredible flowering of innovation and and a lot of wealth creation that that has never seen the like in the world and And We hope that some of y'all have that same experience hopefully investing in YC companies It's still possible And there's lots of examples and if if we're lucky some of the folks who are going to talk to you will give you some of those examples So we also hope that you all go to be better smarter investors after this course I'm sure that's why some of you are here some of you are here to get some of those Insights, and I'm sure also that you will tell us if if we achieve that goal And lastly we want to create a permanent repository of this information so anyone Can make use of it? in future years So we hope to make the repository better and better and in fact if there's anything that you all you can you can look at This online at investors that startup school org and if there's anything you think we should add Just mail it to startup school at Y combinator comm and and what we'll look at it, and if we like it, we'll add it Okay Very briefly now We have four days about ten hours so We can only cover so much. This is going to be about the fundamentals of startup investing There'll be a few deeper dives, but not that many we want to hit the major points Kind of like a An investing 101 I guess we will start off with fundamental questions of why how and which companies and That's today, and then we'll talk about the mechanics of startup investing clearly many of you know these mechanics But I think we'll cover it perhaps in ways you haven't seen before Then we're going to walk through some of the dance that you have to do to make your decisions and to talk with entrepreneurs and founders and And figure out which are the companies that are going to be part of of your investing future we're going to hear from a bunch of extraordinarily experienced and talented at least by the results investors during the course and And And then we're going to complete with a little bit of context and And a little bit of a look towards the the future of startup investing startup investing Has changed radically over the last decade and I think most of us expect a lot more changes in the next decade as well and in the end we'll finish up with a conversation about the role that you all Can and may want to play as you think about your role as an investor and what that means I? Hope you all make it to the end. I think it's going to be really useful And I think we have a pretty great lineup of instructors That'll be very relevant and useful to everyone You
