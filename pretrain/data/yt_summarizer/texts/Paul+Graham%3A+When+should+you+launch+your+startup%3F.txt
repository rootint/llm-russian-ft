Okay, so the risk of launching early is not as great as the risk of launching late. It's not like there's only risk on one side, right? There's a risk of launching late, too. So you've got to have a rule of thumb about when to launch. And my rule of thumb, the way I, like, I have this phrase for it that didn't become as sticky is minimum viable product, because it describes what the minimum viable product has. But it's a quantum of utility, right? Launch as soon as you have a quantum of utility, which means as soon as you're, there's one person in the world who is glad that you launched, because now they can do something that they couldn't do. When there's, when you, if you don't, if you have something that if you launched it, no one would be happy, then you're not ready to launch, right? As soon as there's at least somebody out there who would say, oh, here's this thing I can use, because I can do X, and before that I couldn't do it, then you should launch. As soon as you have a quantum of utility. It sounds like there's some utility function, like if it makes too many people happy and like one person happy and like a hundred really unhappy, maybe it's not ready. But if you, you know, Paul Buchheit always says if you have ten people who really love your product, that's a good place to be. Yeah, all you need is, if you, that's, if there's ten people who are super excited, totally, totally launch, and like, and nobody else cares. That is perfectly fine. That's great.
