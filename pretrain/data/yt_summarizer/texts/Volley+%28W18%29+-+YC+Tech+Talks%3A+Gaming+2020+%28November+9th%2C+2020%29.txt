Hey, how's it going? I'm Max. I'm co-founder of a company called Volley for voice control devices like Alexa and Google Home devices. We have the number one most popular game on both those platforms, which is sort of a name that tune music trivia game called Song Quiz. And we also have some kind of rising star games in the areas of like choose your own adventure style interactive storytelling, as well as a pretty ambitious RPG style voice controlled game that we're working on that we're pretty excited about. So I think it's kind of an interesting company because it'll be the first company, you know, entire interface you're designing for is, is brand new. It's this voice experience. You know, there's no touching, there's no clicking. And so we're all kind of learning from scratch. But our company is sort of fortunate to, to be, you know, one of, if not the leader in the space and have been growing really quickly over the last three years as these sort of Alexa and Google Home platforms have expanded. And lest you're concerned, you don't get to work on visuals. Our games are also playable across, you know, devices with screens that are voice controlled as well as voice controlled television. So we're kind of expanding our reach there. Yeah, company has been been growing pretty quickly. We raised a series A about five months ago. So we've been expanding the team really rapidly. We're 25 people in San Francisco, although obviously all remote right now. And we have a couple of really cool tech projects that maybe some folks at this conference might be interested in. We're building our own kind of like Unreal Engine for voice, which we think is like the most ambitious kind of gaming engine for voice controlled software that we're really excited about, as well as a lot of, you know, cool new gaming projects, including the ones I mentioned that are already out as well as new ones that have not been discussed or released yet. So if you're interested in working on brand new platform, brand new interface, you know, but with the leader in the space and you know, good growth, reach out to me after and hiring engineers, data scientists, designers all across the board. So I'd love to chat. Thanks so much.
