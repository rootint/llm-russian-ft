I want to talk for a second about low points because I think people never appreciate how bad they really are And I think it's always reassuring to hear that even Mark Zuckerberg went through some serious low points and came out Okay, so can you tell us about some of the hardest parts in the history of the early history of Facebook? Yeah, I think one of the hardest parts for me was Was actually when Yahoo offered to buy the company for for a lot of money because up until that point that was this turning point in the company where before that we Every day, we just come in and kind of do what we thought was the right next thing to do Right, we'd open to more schools. We we open to high school and open beyond schools and You know launched more photos Because because that's what seemed like the next thing that we needed to do to help people express themselves and understand more what was going on around them but then you know Yahoo came in with this With this really meaningful offer right? I mean a billion dollars for this is how far into the company I was a couple of years in right and you know, we had 10 million people using the product at the time right, so it wasn't like It wasn't as if it were obvious that we were gonna succeed far beyond that and that was the first point where we really had to To look at the future and say wow Is what we're gonna build going to actually Be so much more meaningful for this and you know That caused a lot of interesting conversations in the company and and with our investors and you know At the end of that Dustin and I just decided you know No we think that we can actually go connect more than just the 10 million people who are in schools we can go beyond that and And have this really be a successful thing and we decided to go for it but that was really stressful because a lot of people really thought that we should sell the company and And you know for a lot of folks who joined a startup I feel like at that point I hadn't been very good about communicating that we were trying to go for this mission Yeah You know We just showed up every day and yeah and just kind of did what we thought was the right next thing to do So for a lot of the folks who joined early on that there weren't really aligned with me right for them you know, they joined and You know being able to sell a company for a billion dollars After a couple years was that was like a home run right and and it is a home run right and and that's you know I think that that's um, I get that but You know that I think that the fact that I didn't communicate very well about what we were trying to do Caused caused this huge tension and the part that was painful wasn't wasn't turning down the offer It was the fact that after that a huge amounts of the company quit because I didn't believe in and what we were what we were Doing right? I mean if you look at the management team that we had did that whole management team leave the whole management team It was gone within Within about a year after that. Did you ever regret that decision in that period like where there are times where you're like Well, we should have sold. Um, you know, we were I was I got really lucky because You know not only did did what I believed in end up working out, but it ended up working out pretty quickly, right? so it literally, you know, I think this was in the summer of 2006 and by I think the next month after that we launched newsfeed right which now ten years later looking back at it as you know, one of the Most used products in the world and then we launched the ability for anyone to sign up which immediately started growing the community So within a few months after turning down the offer, I think it was actually pretty clear that that was the right decision But you know, I think you know since then there have been much harder decisions that we've had to make where you know sometimes you have to you have to bet on something and and You know either, you know bet the direction of the company or you know bet billions of dollars on something It's not gonna be clear whether you're right for five or ten years and you know that I think actually can end up being much Harder than that's what I want to talk about next But before we go there, have you ever thought about selling the company again since no after that point? It's just yeah got that out of the way. We're gonna hire people that want to be here for a long time. Yeah, cool You
