Hi, everyone. I'm Andy. I'm one of the co-founders at Raman VR. And Lauren and I, my other co-founder, are working on Zenith, a massively multiplayer online world. So Zenith is kind of like Dark Souls meets World of Warcraft in that it combines adrenaline pumping, action adventure gameplay with a colorful open world. But best of all, it's in VR. So Zenith features hyper immersive combat that's only possible in VR. You'll be able to parry the cold steel of your enemy's blade, slam your staff like Gandalf, and even dodge bullets while slowing time. And while Zenith the game is already fun, we've built out our back end technology stack to be infinitely scalable, allowing us to theoretically create a limitless world. So our goal is to ultimately make Zenith a metaverse where anyone can come and create and host and play in their own virtual worlds. And when we started Raman VR last year, VR games were a $300 million market. And the newest device was the Oculus Quest. And in just a year, revenue from VR games is expected to top a billion dollars. And the newest device is now the Quest 2. So obviously, we think this is a hugely growing and expanding market. And we've been able to capitalize tremendously on the growth of the VR market. Last year, we ran the most successful VR gaming Kickstarter of all time, selling $280,000 in pre-orders. And just this month, we were able to secure funding and a marketing deal with Oculus, who's the biggest player in the space. We're currently hiring for environment artists, tech artists, and graphics engineers to help us build the next virtual world. So yeah, come find us if you're interested.
