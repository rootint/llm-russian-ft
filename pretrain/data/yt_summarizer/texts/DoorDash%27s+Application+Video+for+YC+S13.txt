Hey, I'm Stanley. I'm a Stanford CS major. I did fund and engineering at Facebook. Hey, I'm Andy. I'm also a Stanford CS major, and I did platform engineering at Facebook. I'm Evan. I was on the founding team of Vivo, the music video service. And I'm Tony. I was a product editor at Square. And the four of us came together about six months ago to work on software for small business owners. But we didn't have a need at first, so we just went out and talked to all the small business owners we could find. After over 100 interviews, we came across a really interesting problem with small business restaurants in an area like this, Palo Alto. Yeah, so it turns out restaurants in Palo Alto don't deliver, even though they really want to, but they can't afford it. But their consumers are craving for it, but the places that the consumers love just can't deliver. And we also found out about these delivery drivers who had a ton of spare time, and they all want to earn extra cash during that downtime. Right, and so that's when we built an initial product, PaloAltoDelivery.com. And how it worked is the customer goes to the website and places an online order that gets automatically sent to the restaurant. And then we, as the dispatchers, with some pretty neat routing and badging algorithms, were able to send the drivers efficiently to get the orders to the customers at a really fast time. Yeah, and the four of us actually started off as delivery drivers. And over time, we hired more as we grew. And in our first month of launch, with not much marketing, we got over 150 paying customers in the Palo Alto area, which was really awesome. And from that, we generated over $10,000 in sales.
