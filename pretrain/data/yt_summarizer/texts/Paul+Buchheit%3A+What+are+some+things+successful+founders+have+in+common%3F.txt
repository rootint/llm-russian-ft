So, this was actually where the focus, frugality, obsession, and love thing came from, is I was actually trying to distill it down into a small enough number of words, and then I was going to try to translate it into emoji, but I failed at that part. I couldn't figure out the, I couldn't figure out what is the emoji for obsession. They're like, love, I'm like, okay, a heart. But there is, I think, like this obsessive focus. There's almost an irrationality in some of these founders. Like the example that comes up as like the most insane version of it is probably like Elon Musk. So I actually, he came into Google, gave like a tech talk, I want to say 2003 or something like that, and it was after he had started SpaceX, but before they had done the first rocket launch. And someone is like, what are you going to do if the rocket explodes when you launch it? He's like, well, I have enough money for three launches, so I hope one of them succeeds. Like he literally plowed his entire fortune. The first three blew up, too, I think. Yeah, the first three did blow up. They managed to scrape together enough money for like a fourth rocket, but if that fourth rocket hadn't gone, there would be no SpaceX, and Elon would be bankrupt, right? Like he, like that is insane. I would not take all of my money and plow it into like some harebrained rocket scheme, right? Like that's like a level of irrationality that is, I think, like wonderful.
