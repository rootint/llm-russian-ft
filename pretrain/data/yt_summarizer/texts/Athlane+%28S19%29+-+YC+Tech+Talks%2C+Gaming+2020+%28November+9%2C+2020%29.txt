Yeah, so like I said, I'm the co-founder of Athlane. And so if you're at this talk, you've probably watched a live stream before. Oftentimes what's not captured in that stream is what these creators endure to deliver that viewership experience, whether it's perfecting their gameplay, building an audience or curating their content. It's a struggle to kind of take streaming to the next level and turn it into a full-time job. So that's where our company comes into play. Athlane is where creators connect with brands to make streaming their career. So this is just a smaller quote from one of our investors, Ninja. Our team is building the future of the creator economy, and our product is loved by creators and brands alike with a ton of marketing teams at companies like Reebok, Herman Miller, and a bunch of others running hundreds of creative campaigns with streamers each and every day. If you're interested in video gaming, if you watch Twitch on the daily, if you love to solve challenging problems that connects disparate groups of people together, we should chat. Would love to kind of talk with anyone who's looking for an engineering role, anyone who's looking for an operations role, and anyone who's super customer empathetic. So yeah, thank you so much, Ryan, Jay, and the rest of the team for organizing. Yeah, we'd love to chat with you guys.
