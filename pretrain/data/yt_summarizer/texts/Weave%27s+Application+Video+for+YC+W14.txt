Hi Y Combinator, my name is Brandon Rodman, I'm the CEO of Weave. My name is Clint Berry, I'm the CTO of Weave. And my name is Jared Rodman, I'm the COO of Weave. At its core, Weave is a telephone company. What makes us different than all the other telephone companies out there is that we link up our telephone service with a small business's CRM. We also incorporate text messaging and emailing into our system. When somebody calls into a business using our phone system, all of the patient or customer data will pop up automatically on the computer screen and give them multiple opportunities to communicate with those patients, to interact with them. It also identifies what they can do on that phone call to generate more revenue. So far, we are in the dental community, that's the vertical we chose to start in. We exited a beta in June of this year and we already have 230 paying clients. We're going to eclipse one million in overall revenue for the year. So we're pretty excited. As far as technology goes, we love open source technologies at Weave. All the way from the communication stack to the software we install on the client's computers, we use open source for everything. Our initial alpha version wasn't very modular, wasn't scalable, but we've changed all that. We reworked the whole system so that we have an extremely scalable modular system and some great developers here doing agile development, adding features on a weekly basis. Cool. We hope you guys will consider us. We hope we can be a part of Y Combinator. Thanks. Thanks.
