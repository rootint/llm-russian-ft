2 a.m we have alarm system, we're screaming like hell, it sounds like this this sound in the middle of the night signified a russian missile had struck close by it was february 28th and russia's invasion of ukraine had started four days earlier i woke up we went to the bunker and happy birthday roman roman's mom made a homemade cake and it was kind of yeah happy birthday from the bunker yeah and then alarm system end and we go back to our beds unforgettable experience i would say this is stacy and roman they're the founders of asamic a platform that matches companies with designers for design tasks with 24-hour turnaround we have now more than 100 designers connected most of them are from ukraine with an office in ukraine's capital city kiev the two founders spent their time building their startup typical day was kind of like as a hustle founders mainly it was like spending your work time in the office meeting new people talking to people having interviews we've been living nearby in kiev downtown and had kind of kind of normal life that all changed as 2021 came to a close and russia began moving military forces next to the ukrainian border russia though is still sending more troops to the border stacy and roman now had important considerations unfamiliar to most founders we would understand the risk of the region where we've been living we've been constantly talking with our people with our designers about potential potential threats we shared advices how they can secure them in advance and on february 24th russia attacked ukraine a free and democratic european these are among the darkest hour for europe since the end of world war ii i woke at 7 am from my mom called she said the war started go away to save place i just i called stacy and woke her up and we start an evacuation of our people of our uh uh of ourselves as well we've been just moving out from kiev because kiev being bombed even when we've been riding out of the kiev we see a russian helicopter flew over us there is no safe place in ukraine now so we're but it's it's hard to ignore because it's still we hear air radars every day any place in the ukraine is not the safest place because there are threatness of missile attacks we didn't expect it this full massive scale invasion um so it was surprise for us even we've been preparing for some escalation once the two founders found safety for themselves their concerns and focus shifted to their asamic team to be to be honest the first days were so much about panic and stress for the people who were denying the reality and it was hard to deal with everything that is going on because it was like living a horror movie or a dream but for us having a plan in advance just help us to focus and execute it was more like a robot mode where you're just executing step by step you know what to do you know what funds do you need and things like that the first month for me was really intensive we've been helping everyone so no time to to be depressed or to feel sad or something like that you're just active you're executing executing this emergency plan was key to helping those that needed it most but the emotional toll and trauma exposed itself once that initial hard work was over for me the hardest part was when the photos from bucha were released what i had was a week of actually staring at the wall it was the week where i it was hard for me to focus i was staring most of the time just at the wall thinking my thoughts that kind of photos i it's hard to explain because you know it's it's not only photos you know people from there you know people who love their home there you know stories from there so it's kind of personal every time and this what makes it hard you just cannot be disconnected or be far away for from that after this horrible photos were released we discovered a lot of raping cases and we had a few girls and one one of them was in occupied city so actually a few days straight we've been thinking how to hide her what instruction instructions should we provide her what her relatives should do for like invading her home and so on and so forth for like invaders to not find her these were maybe the the most fears that i had related to the safety of my people we've been kind of like paying for uh we call this kamikaze drivers it's a person who know safe roads in very dangerous locations so they can could write to our person pick them up as their relatives and evacuate them this was the last person getting to the safe place from the occupied city already we're so happy that we just have them safety threats are the most important so if there are some any new common safety threats we see in some region where our people are where we are so the first thing we trying to eliminate any potential problems with safety with control over basic health and safety the two co-founders were still left with a company to run once we done with the basic safety we are focusing to growing our business and getting new designers customers and i would say uh that we've been in touch with our community and with our people uh during this whole the time focus on building business even even despite war we we operated on a on a third day we've been operating like normal and accepting new customers yes military wins the battles but economics this is who yeah the war so we decided to stay here to spend here to to bring more foreign money to our economy to onboard more designers who lost their jobs the whole country turned into a startup mode and imagine you living in country and whole country is a startup and you need to help to win and you can do anything you can focus on the economic you as we focus it with stacy or you can go to fight or you can kind of like uh do a bread for various and bake them and give them for free so you can do anything but it's a very special atmosphere i would say startup mode but on the country scale that countrywide startup mode has produced extraordinary resilience by the ukrainian people and has helped slow and even stop some russian advances i'm the most optimistic about ukrainian people about ukrainian society so much power in supporting each other in uniting as people so i'm just proud of these people who kind of like so strong and they able to protect our country the optimism these two co-founders showcase are necessary for any founder building a company but even more so for those fighting for the freedom of their country now i think it's more like optimistic future we discussing how we would rebuild the country once this would end that's i would say one of the most active discussions we are so strong we would resist and help ukraine and we would win if you are able to help ukrainians who are fighting on the ground or looking for safety the following organizations need your ongoing support
